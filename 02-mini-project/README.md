#Reflection

Working on the Flappy Bird Project was a highly rewarding experience for us as we had the opportunity to apply the concepts learnt in class. While we were confident of our coding ability to effectively use logic, algorithms, and debugging skills, we discovered that this project required a lot more than coding, in terms of design and creativity. 

To start with, we divided our tasks equally so that each of us could focus on different features of the game. While one of us worked on developing a suitable start screen, switching between day/night modes, and the overall design of the game, the other worked more on logic and algorithms, such as collision detection, gravity, and the scoring metrics. This helped us to progress well and presented the opportunity to impart our knowledge with one another when our tasks overlapped.

Our project was not one without challenges as we were slowed down by even minor issues like the bird not moving or collisions not being detected correctly. Instead of feeling demotivated, we worked through our hurdles together, explored various approaches, and incorporated our ideas to reach a common ground. Our game was mainly built using the skills we had picked up from tutorial sessions such as arrays, objects, functions, and classes. With the use of the class functionality, we were able to create multiple instances that shared the same properties and behaviours, which enabled us to develop our game that felt more like an integrated system with naturally occurring interactions rather an isolated one.

Apart from the basic functionalities, we enjoyed integrating our own touches, such as a start screen, day and night modes, and having a pause/resume functionality. In addition to the fundamental specifications, adding these details provided us with a greater sense of ownership of the project.
